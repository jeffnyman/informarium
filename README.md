# Informarium

Your Gateway to the Inform Universe!

The Informarium is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to illuminate the vast and creative world of the Inform ecosystem. Just as a planetarium reveals the wonders of the cosmos, Informarium reveals the broad landscape of Inform tooling, with a goal to focusing on Inform 7, Inform 6, Inweb and Intest.

This is a work in progress; the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) will be used to keep track of releases and updates.
